=====[MYSQL DATA TYPES]==============================================

=> TIMESTAMP VALUES ARE ALWAYS CONVERTED 
FROM THE CURRENT TIME ZONE TO UTC FOR STORAGE 
AND BACK FROM UTC TO THE CURRENT TIME ZONE 
DURING RETRIEVAL

=> TIMESTAMP IS MORE EFFICIENT COMPARED 
TO DATETIME AND IS MORE APPROPRIATE WHEN THERE 
ARE USERS FROM DIFFERENT TIME ZONES

=> DATETIME VALUES ARE ALWAYS STORED WITH 
THE CURRENT TIME ZONE
